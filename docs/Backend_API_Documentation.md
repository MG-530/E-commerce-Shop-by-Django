# E-commerce Shop Backend API Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

This is a comprehensive backend system for a full-featured e-commerce shop, built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework**. The system is **modular, scalable, and maintainable**, exposing RESTful APIs for:

* User management
* Product catalog
* Shopping carts
* Orders
* Inventory
* Support tickets
* Vendors
* Wishlist
* Returns

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/`. Protected endpoints require a **JWT token** in the `Authorization` header. The authentication endpoint is public.
